# How to install

Step 1: Install NodeJS by running the file called "node-v16.16.0-x64" or "node-v16.16.0-x64.msi" depending on your pc settings. Go through the whole installation process.
You can't use the modmenu without this.

Step 2: Once NodeJS is installed, run the file called "install" or "install.bat" to install the nessecary dependancies.
If you get an error running this, you most likely installed NodeJS wrong or not at all.

Step 3: The modmenu is ready to use! Just run the file called "run" or "run.bat" and it should show in a command prompt. 
I recommand right clicking this file and creating a shortcut. Then put the shortcut anywhere on your pc, like your desktop or documents. With that shortcut you can run the menu from anywhere on your pc.
