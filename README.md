# How to install for Steam on Windows.

Step 1: On this GitHub page, click the green "Code" button. There you will have the option to download as zip.

Step 2: Find your Documents folder. If you don't see it immediately, check "This PC". In Documents, there should be a folder called "packs". If not, it may be somewhere else. In that case you'll have to find it.

Step 3: Extract the zip file to Documents. (Or the folder where "packs" is if not in Documents)

The folder should show like on the picture.

Step 4: Once inside the modmenu folder, install NodeJS by running the file called "node-v16.16.0-x64" or "node-v16.16.0-x64.msi" depending on your pc settings. (Unless you already have it). Go through the whole installation process.
You can't use the modmenu without this.

Step 5: Once NodeJS is installed, run the file called "install" or "install.bat" to install the necessary dependancies.
If you get an error running this, you most likely installed NodeJS wrong or not at all.

Step 6: The modmenu is ready to use! Just run the file called "run" or "run.bat" and it should show in a command prompt. 
I recommand right clicking this file and creating a shortcut. Then put the shortcut anywhere on your pc, like your desktop or documents. With that shortcut you can run the menu from anywhere on your pc.
