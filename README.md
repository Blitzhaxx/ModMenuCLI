# How to install

Step 1: On this GitHub page, click the green "Code" button. There you will have the option to download as zip.

Step 2: Find your Steam installation folder. By default, this path should be something like "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common".

Step 3: Extract the zip file to that folder, called "common". 
![folder](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99101540/180832836-2da3ed2f-1dd7-4375-93b0-9a0ce5dd526e.png)
The folder should show like on the picture between your games.

Step 4: Once inside the modmenu folder, install NodeJS by running the file called "node-v16.16.0-x64" or "node-v16.16.0-x64.msi" depending on your pc settings. Go through the whole installation process.
You can't use the modmenu without this.

Step 5: Once NodeJS is installed, run the file called "install" or "install.bat" to install the nessecary dependancies.
If you get an error running this, you most likely installed NodeJS wrong or not at all.

Step 6: The modmenu is ready to use! Just run the file called "run" or "run.bat" and it should show in a command prompt. 
I recommand right clicking this file and creating a shortcut. Then put the shortcut anywhere on your pc, like your desktop or documents. With that shortcut you can run the menu from anywhere on your pc.
